Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a possible way to write the README file for your script on GitHub:

# Shell Checker

Shell Checker is a Python script that allows you to check multiple web pages at once and verify whether they contain a shell or not. This tool can be useful to scan a set of online pages and make sure that none of them are vulnerable to hacking.

## Usage

To use Shell Checker, follow these steps:

1. Download the script from this repository or copy the source code.
2. Create a new file named "links.txt", and add all the page links you want to check, one per line.
3. In your command-line interface, run the script using the command `python script.py links.txt`.
4. The tool will execute and scan all the pages listed in "links.txt", one by one, to determine whether they contain a shell or not.
5. At the end of the scan, the script will show some statistics, including the number of working and non-working pages found. It will also save the links of the working pages in a new file named "working.txt" and the links of the non-working pages in a file named "not_working.txt".

## Requirements

To run Shell Checker, you need:

- Python 3.x
- aiohttp
- termcolor
